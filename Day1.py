#Bellow is the copied code with my solution as well as the ending code for majority of what was taught.


# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# a = input("a: ")
# b = input("b: ")
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# c = a
# a = b
# b = c
# # You can also use
# # a,b = b,a
